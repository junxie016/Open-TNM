# open-TNM
The open-TNM package is an open-source Toolkit of Network Modeling package written in C++ for solving different transportation network problems, including path-based and origin-based algorithms for the user-equilibrium traffic assignment problems,  traffic assignment problems with side constraints, maximum entropy user equilibrium traffic assignment problems, frequency-based transit assignment problems, continuous bi-criteria traffic assignment problems and so on. This package is written and maintained by Yu (Marco) Nie from Northwestern University and Jun Xie from Southwest Jiaotong University.

# How to Run the Algorithm
• Open the solution in ‘./Greedy/Source/TNA/TNA.sln’ using Visual Studio 2012.

• The main function is in ‘TNADriver.cpp’.

• Modify the parameters in the TestGreedy function.

• Use "Ctrl + F5 " to compile and execute the code.

# How to Run Other Test Problems

• You can download more transportation test networks from https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks and put them in ‘./Greedy/Network/’.

• Note that different networks have different "Generalized Cost Weights", modify the parameters in SetCostCoef() accordingly if you want to obtain the same solution.

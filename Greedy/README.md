# How to Run the Algorithm
• Open the solution in ‘./Greedy/Source/TNA/TNA.sln’ using Visual Studio 2012.

• The main function is in ‘TNADriver.cpp’.

• Modify the parameters in the TestGreedy function.

• Use "Ctrl + F5 " to compile and execute the code.

# How to Run Other Test Problems

• You can download more transportation test networks from https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks and put them in ‘./Greedy/Network/’.

• Please note that different networks feature distinct 'Generalized Cost Weights'. If you aim to reproduce the solution reported in the network, ensure to adjust the parameters in the SetCostCoef() function accordingly.

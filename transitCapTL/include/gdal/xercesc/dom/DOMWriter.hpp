/**
 *
 * DOMWriter provides an API for serializing (writing) a DOM document out in
 * an XML document. The XML data is written to an output stream, the type of
 * which depends on the specific language bindings in use. During
 * serialization of XML data, namespace fixup is done when possible.
 * <p> <code>DOMWriter</code> accepts any node type for serialization. For
 * nodes of type <code>Document</code> or <code>Entity</code>, well formed
 * XML will be created if possible. The serialized output for these node
 * types is either as a Document or an External Entity, respectively, and is
 * acceptable input for an XML parser. For all other types of nodes the
 * serialized form is not specified, but should be something useful to a
 * human for debugging or diagnostic purposes. Note: rigorously designing an
 * external (source) form for stand-alone node types that don't already have
 * one defined in  seems a bit much to take on here.
 * <p>Within a Document or Entity being serialized, Nodes are processed as
 * follows Documents are written including an XML declaration and a DTD
 * subset, if one exists in the DOM. Writing a document node serializes the
 * entire document.  Entity nodes, when written directly by
 * <code>writeNode</code> defined in the <code>DOMWriter</code> interface,
 * output the entity expansion but no namespace fixup is done. The resulting
 * output will be valid as an external entity.  Entity References nodes are
 * serializes as an entity reference of the form
 * <code>"&amp;entityName;"</code>) in the output. Child nodes (the
 * expansion) of the entity reference are ignored.  CDATA sections
 * containing content characters that can not be represented in the
 * specified output encoding are handled according to the
 * "split-cdata-sections" feature.If the feature is <code>true</code>, CDATA
 * sections are split, and the unrepresentable characters are serialized as
 * numeric character references in ordinary content. The exact position and
 * number of splits is not specified. If the feature is <code>false</code>,
 * unrepresentable characters in a CDATA section are reported as errors. The
 * error is not recoverable - there is no mechanism for supplying
 * alternative characters and continuing with the serialization. All other
 * node types (DOMElement, DOMText, etc.) are serialized to their corresponding
 * XML source form.
 * <p> Within the character data of a document (outside of markup), any
 * characters that cannot be represented directly are replaced with
 * character references. Occurrences of '&lt;' and '&amp;' are replaced by
 * the predefined entities &amp;lt; and &amp;amp. The other predefined
 * entities (&amp;gt, &amp;apos, etc.) are not used; these characters can be
 * included directly. Any character that can not be represented directly in
 * the output character encoding is serialized as a numeric character
 * reference.
 * <p> Attributes not containing quotes are serialized in quotes. Attributes
 * containing quotes but no apostrophes are serialized in apostrophes
 * (single quotes). Attributes containing both forms of quotes are
 * serialized in quotes, with quotes within the value represented by the
 * predefined entity &amp;quot;. Any character that can not be represented
 * directly in the output character encoding is serialized as a numeric
 * character reference.
 * <p> Within markup, but outside of attributes, any occurrence of a character
 * that cannot be represented in the output character encoding is reported
 * as an error. An example would be serializing the element
 * &lt;LaCaï¿½ada/&gt; with the encoding="us-ascii".
 * <p> When requested by setting the <code>normalize-characters</code> feature
 * on <code>DOMWriter</code>, all data to be serialized, both markup and
 * character data, is W3C Text normalized according to the rules defined in
 * . The W3C Text normalization process affects only the data as it is being
 * written; it does not alter the DOM's view of the document after
 * serialization has completed.
 * <p>Namespaces are fixed up during serialization, the serialization process
 * will verify that namespace declarations, namespace prefixes and the
 * namespace URIs associated with Elements and Attributes are consistent. If
 * inconsistencies are found, the serialized form of the document will be
 * altered to remove them. The algorithm used for doing the namespace fixup
 * while seralizing a document is a combination of the algorithms used for
 * lookupNamespaceURI and lookupNamespacePrefix . previous paragraph to be
 * defined closer here.
 * <p>Any changes made affect only the namespace prefixes and declarations
 * appearing in the serialized data. The DOM's view of the document is not
 * altered by the serialization operation, and does not reflect any changes
 * made to namespace declarations or prefixes in the serialized output.
 * <p> While serializing a document the serializer will write out
 * non-specified values (such as attributes whose <code>specified</code> is
 * <code>false</code>) if the <code>output-default-values</code> feature is
 * set to <code>true</code>. If the <code>output-default-values</code> flag
 * is set to <code>false</code> and the <code>use-abstract-schema</code>
 * feature is set to <code>true</code> the abstract schema will be used to
 * determine if a value is specified or not, if
 * <code>use-abstract-schema</code> is not set the <code>specified</code>
 * flag on attribute nodes is used to determine if attribute values should
 * be written out.
 * <p> Ref to Core spec (1.1.9, XML namespaces, 5th paragraph) entity ref
 * description about warning about unbound entity refs. Entity refs are
 * always serialized as &amp;foo;, also mention this in the load part of
 * this spec.
 * <p> When serializing a document the DOMWriter checks to see if the document
 * element in the document is a DOM Level 1 element or a DOM Level 2 (or
 * higher) element (this check is done by looking at the localName of the
 * root element). If the root element is a DOM Level 1 element then the
 * DOMWriter will issue an error if a DOM Level 2 (or higher) element is
 * found while serializing. Likewise if the document element is a DOM Level
 * 2 (or higher) element and the DOMWriter sees a DOM Level 1 element an
 * error is issued. Mixing DOM Level 1 elements with DOM Level 2 (or higher)
 * is not supported.
 * <p> <code>DOMWriter</code>s have a number of named features that can be
 * queried or set. The name of <code>DOMWriter</code> features must be valid
 * XML names. Implementation specific features (extensions) should choose an
 * implementation dependent prefix to avoid name collisions.
 * <p>Here is a list of properties that must be recognized by all
 * implementations.
